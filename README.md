# Przybornik Pragmatycznego Programisty Androida - eBook in Polish

## Summary

This ebook was intended to be Lead Magnet at my blog: <a href="http://soldiersofmobile.com">Soldiers of Mobile</a>, but as a geek I could not have missed the oportunity to create an OpenSource book. :) 

This is work in progress and you are more than welcome to contribute! If you don't speak Polish, no worry. I am planing to do translation to english...someday.
